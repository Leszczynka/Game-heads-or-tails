### General info
This is my first project - the game eagle or heads.
The rules of the game are simple.
The user makes a choice: heads or tails.
Our opponent is a computer, which randomly chooses heads or tails. 
A coin toss begins.
Awarding of points:
If the user's choice is the same as the result of the coin toss, the user gets a point. 
If the computer's choice is the same as the result of the coin toss, a point is given to the computer.
If both the user and the computer make good bets on the outcome of the coin toss, points are awarded to both players.
Another round and another coin toss follows.
The game continues until either the user or the computer gets the number of points 3.
You get a message who won the game along with information about the points scored by the user and by the computer.

### Technology
Python version 3.10.2

### Setup
You can run the game by copying the code into your IDE or compile it into an executable (.exe) file and run it.
